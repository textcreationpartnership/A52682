            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>JAmes</hi> a prisoner of Jesus Christ, unto all that love the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ every where, grace and peace be multiplyed from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ; My dear hearts, you whom the Lord hath manifested so much love unto, as to call you out of sin and death, and the world, all the delights and pleasures of the world, which fades away, up to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, where is joy unspeakable, pleasures and riches that endure for evermore. Dear friends, watch and be sober, that you may hear the voice of your beloved when he calleth, and let not the precious proffers of the love of God be tendred in vain; while you have an ear open to the world, you cannot hear the voice of God, so that you have bin made to groan under it: how long have you been deceived by it all your time, promising peace, fulness, and satisfaction, but have bin brought to cry out of oppression and deceit, and your cries are come before the Lord of Sabbaths, who is your rest, and he is now appeared to deliver you, and set you free from bondage, that you may serve him alone. And now take heed of consulting with your old master; hath the Lord been so mercifull unto you, as that he hath set your faces out of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> towards the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed land, O take heed of looking back, lest you be taken captive, and led back again, and so you come short of redemption, and your faith fail you, and so you come short of the promise, for unbelief cannot enter into the rest; but you, Dear friends, put on resolution, put on strength, be valiant for your freedome, cast off every weight, follow your Captain the Lord Jesus Christ, who for the joy set before him, indured the cross, despised the shame, and so entred into rest and glory. Take heed of halting between God and the World; what agreement can there be or what peace, while you are married to the world? Your thoughts turn in thither, and you are adulterated from God, who gives you all good things, as so many tokens of his love; hereby is the broken language brought forth, and you cannot speak the pure language of the land of rest. And while you give way to that in you, which leads you to look back to what is behind you; you keep your selves in the wilderness and darkness, and lose your way, and know not where you are, grieving the holy Spirit of the Lord which hath appeared unto you to guide you: but (O friends!) mind your guide, and follow him; Arise, shine, your light is come, and the glory of the Lord is come upon you, the night is far spent, the day is at hand, even the day of Sions deliverance; Arise, come away all you that love her, come off from the World and worldly things, come into the life, lie no longer in death and dead things. Awake thou that sleepest, and stand up from the dead, that Christ may give thee light: Come forth, come forth of all created things, witness your redemption to all the world, that you are redeemed from the earth upto God, out of all kindreds, tongues, people, and nations, to reign as Kings and Priests for ever, above the world, sin and death, triumphing and treading upon all that would take you captive: This is the day of your deliverance, own it with the loss of all fading pleasures, make it appear to all the world, this is the day you waited for, even the day of your joy, but of the worlds sorrow: A day of blackness and gloominess, a day of fear and trouble to them that oppress you; a day wherein the Kingdome of Jesus Christ shall be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54096:8"/> exalted, and all the kingdoms and powers of the earth shaken; a day wherein the Lord will avenge the power of him that is too strobg for him: Rejoyce, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce ye meek of the earth, shout for joy ye poor despised ones, whom your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have troden upon, and have cast you out, and you have been made their mocking-stocks for the truths sake, Sing and rejoyce, the voice of a King is amongst you, and he will marry you to himself in righteousness, purity, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and will rejoyce over you, as a bridegroom over the bride, and you shall be for a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royall Diademe in the hand of your God. O my dear hearts, my desire to God for you all is, that you might come to see what unspeakable riches is laid up for you in Jesus Christ, which is hid from all flesh, neither can you see it while you live in the flesh; and while you continue your love to the world and worldly things, you keep out the manifestation of the Fathers love, for your hearts canot receive both. Now shew your selves wise men, choose that which is eternal, here is light and life tendred you in Jesus Christ, freely out of the Fathers love, freely receive life and love, and shew forth life and love to God again, by giving up to him all you have and all you are for Christs sake, that so you may come to receive all again with Christ, who is the fulness of the Fathers love, and in him are all good things needfull for this life, and that which is to come, even the earnest of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance which none can take from you, which once being received, you shall never hunger more, having a wel spring within, even the witness of eternal life and love; and as Christ appears, who is our life and love, so shall life and love appear, spring, blossom, and bring forth fruit towards God and man; that so being raised with him from death and dead works, you may henceforth live unto God, and being brought into oneness with him, and purity, and holiness, you may be one amongst your selves, of one heart and one minde, speaking one and the self same thing, and having the same care one for another, as for your selves. And take heed that there be not in any of you a principle of self-love, which once having, will lead to separation and division, casting a stumbling block in the way of the simple; and so they that are weak being defiled and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned back into the world. And I beseech you brethren that you mark them that once set their faces towards Sion, but not being willing to deny the world, and take up the Cross, have consulted with flesh and blood, and turned back into <hi>Egypt</hi> again, of such take heed, knowing that the same spirit that hath wrought in them deceitfully, will not cease to work by them to deceive others to maintain its own Kingdom; but you standing fast in the pure light of Christ, you shall see whither these return, and the cause of their returnings, and that the end of such is worse then the beginning; but there must be such, that they who are approved may be made manifest. But you my Brethren, be ye so far from following such, that their falling away may cause you to watch and search by what power you stand, and so a pure fear may be preserved in you, by which you may be kept in the way that leads to the Crown which is immortall: for it is he that overcomes that must wear the Crown, wherefore faint not, nor think any thing hard, the Lord cals unto you, nothing must suffer but that which is to die, that your souls may live: O your light affliction worketh for you a far more exceeding weight of glory, while you keep your eye to that which is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; wherefore give up your selves to his will in all things. Stand in the will
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54096:9"/> of God in your present condition, you are my joy in the Lord; let my bowels be refreshed to hear of your stedfas<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ness and growth in the Truth: Take heed of propounding ends to your selves in any thing, for that leads out of the way of God, and gives way to your own wisdom; and so you seek to preserve that alive which is appointed for death, and so you maintain war against God, and knows not, and in this condition you can have no peace, while the enemies are in arms against your peace. O, dear Friends, you are in my heart, my prayer to God for you is, that you may be kept blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, blessed for ever. My fellow prisoner, and dear companion in the Lord salutes you all: Cease not to pray for us, that we may be kept to his praise, who hath counted us worthy to suffer for his Name, we are well, and in great peace, kept in our Fathers love; above all, we are often brought to stand and wonder how we are kept in the midst of the fire, and yet not consumed; and the more that the enemy rages, the more are we kept in peace within: Here are strange De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices used to insnare us, to get ought against us (true or false) but all is Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by a power the World knows not, God is our strength; Rejoyce with us all, dear Friends, and praise his Name for evermore, for he is worthy, for his Mercy endures for ever.</p>
